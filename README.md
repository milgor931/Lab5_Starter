1. I would say that using a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application might not be the best option because since the message is being sent to another user and might require more complexity in how this action is handled. It is also difficult to test how it interacts/gets sent to the user because this means that the application is interacting with another user on a whole other level.
2. I think that using a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application is a good idea because this is a small scale test of a specific part of the feature that can help test the functionality. It doesn't have many moving parts like the first question and allows for an easy test of an individual component of the project.
